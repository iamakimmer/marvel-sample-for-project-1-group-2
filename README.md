You will have to install a server to run this code, because the marvel api requires you to whitelist the source of requests.

Try in command line: 

npm install http-server --global

Then Try in command line:

http-server

This will be default run a server on your computer @ 127.0.0.1 (this is equivalent to localhost) at port 8080. Try visiting in your browser this url:

127.0.0.1:8080
